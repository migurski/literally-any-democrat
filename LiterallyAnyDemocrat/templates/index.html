<h3>What States Are Included?</h3>

<p>
    We are initially including candidates for
    <a href="https://swingleft.org/p/super-states">Swing Left Super States</a>
    whose filing deadlines have passed.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Last cycle, Swing Left pointed you towards your closest Swing District as
    the most effective place to focus your volunteer time and donations. And
    everybody is familiar with Swing States. But the 2020 cycle is giving us
    something new and exciting: what we‚Äôre calling the ‚ÄúSuper States.‚Äù If you
    overlay the target maps, the most important battles to win the White House,
    the Senate, and the once-in-a-decade fight to control redistricting are
    concentrated in the same few states. By focusing on them, we can maximize
    the impact of our efforts, working on many or all of these important
    contests at the same time.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Currently, that‚Äôs mostly Texas and North Carolina. We will add candidates
    as more filing deadlines pass and narrow them down to general election
    candidates after primary elections happen in Spring and Summer 2020.
